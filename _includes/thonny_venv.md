1.  Create a virtual environment for your project. A virtual environment is like a boxed enclosure that contains all the Python libraries and packages that are needed for your code to run. Click **Tools > Options**, and then click **Interpreter**. Make sure that the interpreter is `Local Python 3`. Then, click **New virtual environment** and follow the onscreen guidance to create an empty folder and designate it as the place where your project will live. When everything's done, click **OK**.

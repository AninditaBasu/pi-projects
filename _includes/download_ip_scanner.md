If you don't plan to use an external mouse, keyboard, and monitor with your Raspberry Pi, you'll need to connect to it through your laptop. To do so, you need the IP address of the Raspberry Pi. A network scanner can show you the IP addresses of all devices that are connected to your network. One such network scanner is Angry IP Scanner.

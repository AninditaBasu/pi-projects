1.  Set up Raspberry Pi Connect so that you can control the Raspberry Pi through a browser by using the Raspberry Pi's desktop GUI itself. At the moment, you're already logged into the Raspberry Pi through your laptop via SSH, but you can use only the terminal window when you're so logged in; you can't use the Raspberry Pi's desktop GUI. With the Connect software, you can log into your Raspberry Pi through any browser, and use it through its desktop environment.
    1.  Install Connect by running the following command in the terminal of the Raspberry Pi: `sudo apt install rpi-connect`.
	1.  Start Connect by running the following command in the terminal of the Raspberry Pi: `rpi-connect on`.
	1.  Generate a link that will connect your Raspberry Pi computer with your Connect account by running the following command from the terminal: `rpi-connect signin`. You're shown a sign-in URL on the terminal.
	1.  On your laptop, open a browser, type the URL shown on the Raspberry Pi terminal window, and follow the onscreen prompts to complete the signin and authentication process.
	1.  In the same browser window, specify a name to identify your device, and click **Create device and sign in**.

# {{ page.title }}

A surveillance camera continuously records the happenings that it can 'see'. For this project, this job will be done by a bash script.

The operating system that you installed on the Raspberry Pi already includes `libcamera`, which is the package that will be used for recording videos.

## The steps

1.  If you don't have an external keyboard or mouse, log in remotely to your Raspberry Pi by using Connect:
    1.  On your laptop, open `https://connect.raspberrypi.com/` and sign in.
	1.  On the Devices page, click **Connect via > Screen sharing**, and wait for a few seconds for the remote session to start. You should then see the Raspberry Pi desktop in your laptop browser window.
1.  Install any patches, fixes, and upgrades that might have been made to the operating system by opening the Raspberry Pi terminal window (the console icon near the top left) and running the following two commands one after the other:
    -  `sudo apt-get update`
	-  `sudo apt-get upgrade`
1.  Open a terminal window by clicking the Terminal icon near the top left. At the prompt, go to the `Videos` directory by typing the following command: `cd ~/Videos`. This is the directory that will contain the bash script and the videos.
1.  Open a new file by typing the following command: `nano simplevideo.sh`. The built-in code editor, called `nano`, opens. 
1.  Copy into it the code from [The script, plain](#the-script-plain) section of this page. Then, save the file and exit the nano editor by doing these steps:
    1.  Press Ctrl + O. The editor displays the name that the file should be saved with. You've already specified it to be `simplevideo.sh`.
	1.  Press Enter. The file is saved.
	1.  Press Ctrl + X. You're taken back to the command prompt.
1.  Turn the bash script into an executable file by typing the following command: `chmod +x simplevideo.sh`.
1.  Run the file by typing the following command: `./simplevideo.sh`. You should start seeing some messages on the screen.

Go to the directory where your videos are being saved (Click the File Manager icon near the top left). To view the a video file, double-click the file.

## The script, plain

```
{% include bashscript_simplevideo.sh %}
```

## The script, explained

Notice the second line of the script.

```
SAVE_PATH="/home/oracle/Videos"
```

This is where you specify the directory to save the videos to. Replace `oracle` with the user name that you set up the Raspberry Pi with.

Notice the next line:

```
DURATION=$((60 * 1000))  # 1 minute in milliseconds
```

The duration tells the script how long each video should be.

Now look at the last bit:

```
libcamera-vid --nopreview --width 640 --height 480 --bitrate 1000000 --timeout $DURATION -o "$SAVE_PATH/ve_$TIMESTAMP.h264"
```

What's happening here that a video is being saved every 1 minute to the location you specified.

-  `libcamera-vid`: This is part of the Raspberry Pi's `libcamera` stack, and it handles video recording.
-  `--nopreview`: Tells the system not to open a preview window because the script in running in the background in headless mode.
-  `--width 640 --height 480`: Sets the video resolution to 640Ã—480 pixels. A lower resolution means smaller files and faster processing. You could change this to `--width 1280 --height 720` or higher for better quality but doing so uses up more computer resources.
-  `--bitrate 1000000`: Sets the video compression level to 1,000,000 bits per second (that is, 1 Mbps). A higher bitrate means better video quality but larger files. For better visuals, you could increase this to 3000000.
-  `----timeout $DURATION`: This sets how long the video recording lasts in milliseconds. You've already specified the value through the `$DURATION` variable.
-  `-o "$SAVE_PATH/ve_$TIMESTAMP.h264"`: Specifies where to save the video file and with what name. `"$SAVE_PATH"` is a variable holding your directory (for example, `/home/oracle/Pictures`). `ve_$TIMESTAMP.h264` names the file with a timestamp (like `ve_20250420_135030.h264`). `.h264` is the raw video format. You can convert it to `.mp4` if needed.

# Digital photo frame

In this tutorial, I show you how to use a Raspberry Pi 3B+ computer and a Raspberry Pi Touch Display to make a photo frame that pulls images from a local drive (SD card, USB storage, or similar) and displays them for a few seconds each. Along the way, I explain how to set up a headless Raspberry Pi computer, connect it to a touch display, and then run Python on it.

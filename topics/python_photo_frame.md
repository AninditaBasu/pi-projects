A digital photo frame reads the image files from a storage device, and displays them on the screen for a specified time. For the photo frame that you're building, this job will be done by a Python program.

The operating system that you installed on the Raspberry Pi already includes Python, as well as an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easier for you to write, run, and edit Python programs. This IDE is the Thonny IDE. You'll use Thonny to write the photo frame program.

```python
{% include _includes/pyscript_photo_frame.py %}
```
